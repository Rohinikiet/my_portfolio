It includes a profile photo, introductory text, and navigation buttons for different sections (About, Skills, Contact, Projects). The component also features social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube) displayed in the footer. The `scrollToSection` function is used to smoothly scroll to the specified section when a navigation button is clicked.

This is a React component named `Projects` representing the "My Projects" section of a website. It includes a heading and a list of projects, each displayed as a box containing a title, description, project image, and a link to the project repository on GitHub. The component uses an external CSS file for styling and imports project images and their details from separate files.

The progress bars are styled with CSS, and the width of each bar is determined by the skill percentage.

**Contact Component:**
The `Contact` component represents the "Contact Me" section of a website. It includes a heading, a brief message, and contact information displayed in two sections: "Contact Info" and "Social Media." The contact information includes email and phone details, and social media links are provided with FontAwesome icons.
